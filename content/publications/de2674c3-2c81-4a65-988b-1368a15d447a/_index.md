  title: Translating phenotypic prediction models from big to small anatomical MRI data
    using meta-matching
  description: Individualized phenotypic prediction based on structural MRI is an important
    goal in neuroscience. Prediction performance increases with larger samples, but
    small-scale datasets with fewer than 200 participants are often unavoidable. We
    have previously proposed a "meta-matching" framework to translate models trained
    from large datasets to improve the prediction of new unseen phenotypes in small
    collection efforts. Meta-matching exploits correlations between phenotypes, yielding
    large improvement over classical machine learning when applied to prediction models
    using resting-state functional connectivity as input features. Here, we adapt the
    two best performing meta-matching variants ("meta-matching finetune" and "meta-matching
    stacking") from our previous study to work with T1-weighted MRI data by changing
    the base neural network architecture to a 3D convolution neural network. We compare
    the two meta-matching variants with elastic net and classical transfer learning
    using the UK Biobank (N = 36,461), Human Connectome Project Young Adults (HCP-YA)
    dataset (N = 1,017) and HCP-Aging dataset (N = 656). We find that meta-matching
    outperforms elastic net and classical transfer learning by a large margin, both
    when translating models within the same dataset, as well as translating models across
    datasets with different MRI scanners, acquisition protocols and demographics. For
    example, when translating a UK Biobank model to 100 HCP-YA participants, meta-matching
    finetune yielded a 136% improvement in variance explained over transfer learning,
    with an average absolute gain of 2.6% (minimum = -0.9%, maximum = 17.6%) across
    35 phenotypes. Overall, our results highlight the versatility of the meta-matching
    framework.
