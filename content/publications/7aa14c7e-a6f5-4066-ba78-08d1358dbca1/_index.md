  description: "Multimatch-gaze is a Python package for computing the similarity of\
    \ eye-movement sequences, so called scan paths. Scan paths are the trace of eye-movements\
    \ in space and time, usually captured with eye tracking devices. Scan path similarity\
    \ is a measure that is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from cognitive psychology,\
    \ medicine, and marketing to human-machine interfaces. In addition to quantifying\
    \ position and order of a series of eye-movements, comparing their temporo-spatial\
    \ sequence adds an insightful dimension to the traditional analysis of eye tracking\
    \ data. It reveals commonalities and differences of viewing behavior within and\
    \ between observers, and is used to study how people explore visual information.\
    \ For example, scan path comparisons are used to study analogy-making (French, Glady,\
    \ & Thibaut, 2017), visual exploration and imagery (Johansson, Holsanova, & Holmqvist,\
    \ 2006), habituation in repetitive visual search (Burmester & Mast, 2010), or spatial\
    \ attention allocation in dynamic scenes (Mital, Smith, Hill, & Henderson, 2011).\
    \ The method is applied within individuals as a measure of change (Burmester & Mast,\
    \ 2010), or across samples to study group differences (French et al., 2017).Therefore,\
    \ in recent years, interest in the study of eye movement sequences has sparked the\
    \ development of novel methodologies and algorithms to perform scan path comparisons.\
    \ However, many of the contemporary scan path comparison algorithms are implemented\
    \ inclosed-source, non-free software such as Matlab.Multimatch-gaze is a Python-based\
    \ reimplementation of the MultiMatch toolbox for scanpath comparison, originally\
    \ developed by Jarodzka, Holmqvist, & Nystr\xF6m (2010) and implemented by Dewhurst\
    \ et al. (2012) in Matlab. This algorithm represents scan paths asgeometrical vectors\
    \ in a two-dimensional space: Any scan path is built up of a coordinate vector sequence\
    \ in which the start and end position of vectors represent fixations, and the vectors\
    \ represent saccades. Two such vector sequences are, after optional simplification\
    \ based on angular relations and amplitudes of saccades, compared on the five dimensions\
    \ \u201Cvector shape\u201D, \u201Cvector length (amplitude)\u201D, \u201Cvector\
    \ position\u201D, \u201Cvector direction\u201D, and \u201Cfixation duration\u201D\
    \ for a multidimensional similarity evaluation.This reimplementation in Python aims\
    \ at providing an accessible, documented, and tested open source alternative to\
    \ the existing MultiMatch toolbox. The algorithm is an established tool for scan\
    \ path comparison (N. C. Anderson, Anderson, Kingstone, & Bischof, 2015),and improved\
    \ availability aids adoption in a broader research community. multimatch-gaze is\
    \ available from its Github repository and as the Python package multimatch-gaze\
    \ via pip install multimatch-gaze. The module contains the same functionality as\
    \ the original Matlab toolbox, that is, scan path comparison with optional simplification\
    \ according to userdefined thresholds, and it provides this functionality via a\
    \ command line interface or a PythonAPI. Data for scan path comparison can be supplied\
    \ as nx3 fixation vectors with columns corresponding to x-coordinates, y-coordinates,\
    \ and duration of the fixation in seconds (as for the original Matlab toolbox).\
    \ Alternatively, multimatch-gaze can natively read in event detection output produced\
    \ by REMoDNaV (Dar, Wagner, & Hanke, 2019), a velocity-based eye movement classification\
    \ algorithm written in Python. For REMoDNaV-based input, users can additionally\
    \ specify whether smooth pursuit events in the data should be kept in the scan path\
    \ or discarded. "
